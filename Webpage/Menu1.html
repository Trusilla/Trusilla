	One thing I'm very passionate about is music. I can't imagine life without music. Some of my favorite artists are Childish Gambino, Summer Walker, Marvin Gaye, Erykah Badu, Whitney Houston, drake, chance the rapper, etc... The list can go on and on but my favorite artist at the time is Roddy Ricch. Check out one of his songs on the vido below!
